=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/siims/ansible-role-thumbor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/siims/ansible-role-thumbor)

Ansible script that installs Thumbor smart imaging service for linux (see: http://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Currently Thumbor version frozen to 5.2.1.

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
